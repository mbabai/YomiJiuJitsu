# YomiJiuJitsu

The only files that need to be edited are:
- Arena.py (this is the main code on the server side, running with Tornado)
- The HTML files under the "Templates" folder. This will change the html that is generated by the python script and sent to clients.
- The JS/CSS files under the "Static" folder. This is the client side scripting.
